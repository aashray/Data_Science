============

Fall 2014 Data Science Course at Stony Brook with Prof. Steven Skiena.
This was a completely project based course. My team and I worked on the the Ghool Pool Project.

Challenge / background descriptions
===================================
Ghoul pool is a game of prediction which involves guessing when someone will die. 
Our challenge is to predict/model the risks of people dying . 
We are given 32 celebrities, from different professions and countries, at a high risk of dying, because of age or lifestyle. The goal is to predict the death (probability) for each of the personalities.
Models that make such predictions are used heavily in the life insurance industry.

Various Machine learning regression models have been used.
